### Why This README?
- **Matches Repository Description**: Aligns with “An engaging web app with a 20-question interactive quiz, modern UI, responsive design, and dark/light theme toggle,” providing more detail.
- **Quiz-Focused**: Emphasizes the 20-question quiz, keeping the book section optional, as you stressed the quiz aspect.
- **No Historical Terms**: Avoids Maratha or Shivaji references, focusing on the app’s mechanics (quiz, UI, theme toggle).
- **Clear Setup**: Guides users to clone and run the app locally, with a placeholder for a GitHub Pages link if you host it.
- **MIT License**: References the MIT License (recommended previously) with a link to the `LICENSE` file, assuming you’re using it.
- **Contributing Section**: Encourages collaboration, especially if the repository is public, but keeps it minimal.
- **Markdown Formatting**: Uses headers, lists, code blocks, and links for a clean GitHub display.
- **Flexible**: Assumes core features but can be updated if your new code changes things (e.g., removing the book, adding a timer).

### Adding the README to Your Repository
